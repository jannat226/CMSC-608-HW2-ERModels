## Project Description
# CMSC 608 - Homework 2: Entity-Relationship Diagrams


## Overview
This repository contains the **ER diagrams and documentation** for **Homework 2** of CMSC 608 (Spring 2025). The assignment involves designing **Chen notation (Graphviz)** and **Crowâ€™s Foot notation (Mermaid)** ER diagrams for three selected problems.

## Selected Problems
We have designed ER diagrams for the following systems:
1. **Library Management System** - Models books, members, and loans.
2. **Restaurant Reservation System** - Models customers, reservations, and tables.
3. **School Course Enrollment System** - Models students, courses, and enrollments.

## Contents of `report.qmd`
- **Introduction**: Explanation of ER diagrams.
- **Chen Notation Diagrams (Graphviz)** for each problem.
- **Crowâ€™s Foot Notation Diagrams (Mermaid)** for each problem.
- **Relational schemas** for database implementation.
- **Discussion on design choices** (e.g., weak entities, composite attributes).
